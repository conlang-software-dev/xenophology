# Xenophonology

After installing and running `npm run build`:

1. Run `node bin\glossolalia.js {x} {y}` to generate a romanized representation of a phonotactically-correct random utterance of `x` words of up to `y` syllables each.
2. Run `node bin\synth.js {romanization}` to generate a WAV audio file with the audio representation of the electric field patterns specified by the romanization.

The sample "noise_1.wav" was generated from the glossolalic utterance "ni'doni 'y sogu'xu bipacu'yi hy'pi ba'bal 'hbabami hso'kodi 'n vi'fi 'hko".
The sample "noise_2.wav" was generated from the glossolalic utterance "hwosol'ku 'wu 'labaza hsar'cu kowuw'yi 'l hmi'yu hl'koku 'hmazami hto'go 'hmiyi".
